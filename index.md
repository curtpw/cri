# [](#empathy)Building Group Empathy with Sensors, Wearables and Biofeedback

In a society that constantly emphasizes the individual it can be difficult to step in a stranger's shoes and see things from their perspective. In this project we will step into stranger’s bodies. Several wearable devices will be built capable of exchanging data with each other over a network. Each device will sense viscerally experienced bio-signals, for example heartbeat and respiration. Each device will also be capable of providing biofeedback which mimic these bio-signals, for example haptic feedback which ebbs and flows as a breath is taken or a pulsing solenoid (linear actuator) which presses into the chest in time with a heart beat. When a single user is not facing any other users, the biofeedback functions play back the user’s own vital signs, making them more aware of their body. When two users are facing each other, they exchange data and feel each other’s vital signs as if they had stepped into each other’s body. When a plurality of users face a single user, all users feel that focal individual's vital signs, subsuming the group into that individual. A number of wearable form factors could be suitable, the chest and head would be ideal mounting points. These devices could be used in group therapy, team building or any number of other applications.

# [](#autism-audio)Audacious Audio for Autism and ADHD: Environmental Audio Acquisition, Processing and Delivery On a Wearable Device

Auditory overstimulation and sensory processing issues are a significant problem for Autistic and ADHD individuals. In this project we will build a wearable device which can acquire and distinguish between environmental audio sources using microphone arrays and directional microphones. The device will process and filter environmental audio data using a microcontroller, Raspberry Pi or similar. Once the desired audio has been isolated it will be delivered to the user in an inconspicuous low profile fashion, for example bone conduction transducers. When combined with low-profile transparent ear plugs or over-ear noise blocking earmuffs, this device should substantially increase the quality of life for those who use it.

# [](#eye-track)Smart Glasses for the Education and Mental Health

Eye movement and gaze direction can tell us an incredible amount of information about what a person is thinking and feeling. Eye activity can tell us if a student is generally inattentive and of course what they are specifically looking at. Eye movement may even be used to diagnose autism and ADHD. Despite this, it is a signal rarely if ever used in wearable devices. In this project we will build a low profile wearable eye activity and head tracker into a normal looking pair of eyeglasses. This device will be capable of measuring general levels of eye movement, rough gaze direction and angular position of the head. Because this device is low profile, simplified sensor strategies must be used instead of an eye facing camera. For example, infrared and high resolution proximity sensors to leverage the irregular color and shape of the eyeball. Low profile feedback about attentiveness or other detected behavior will be provided to the user - possibly haptic motors or strategically placed LEDs.
